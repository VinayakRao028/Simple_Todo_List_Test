# This file is intentionally left empty as Dart/Flutter projects don't use Gradle for configuration.
# The equivalent functionality is handled by the pubspec.yaml file and the project structure.

# For Flutter projects:
# - Dependencies are managed in pubspec.yaml
# - Project structure is defined by the Flutter framework
# - Plugins are automatically detected and included by Flutter

# If you need to include custom build settings or dependencies,
# refer to the pubspec.yaml file in the root of your Flutter project.
