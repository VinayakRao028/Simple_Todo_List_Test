# Launch Screen Assets

You can customize the launch screen with your own desired assets by replacing the image files in this directory.

To customize the launch screen:

1. Open your Flutter project's Xcode project with `open ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
2. In the Project Navigator, select `Runner/Assets.xcassets`
3. Locate the `LaunchImage` asset catalog
4. Replace the existing image files with your desired launch screen images
5. Make sure to provide images for all required resolutions and device sizes

Remember to follow Apple's guidelines for launch screen design to ensure a smooth app review process.

## Image Requirements

- Provide images for all supported device sizes and resolutions
- Use PNG format for best quality and transparency support
- Follow Apple's Human Interface Guidelines for launch screen design
