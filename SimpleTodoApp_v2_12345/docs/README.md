- Python
- AI Service Integration

### Frontend
- TypeScript
- React
- Bootstrap

### Cloud Services
- (Specific cloud platform details to be added)

### Testing
- JUnit (Java)
- pytest (Python)
- React Testing Library (Frontend)

## Project Structure

│   └── python (Python services)
├── cloud (Cloud service configurations)
├── docs (Project documentation)
├── frontend (React application)
└── tests (Test suites for backend and frontend)
```

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 11 or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- npm or yarn
- (Any cloud-specific CLI tools)

### Backend Setup

#### Java Backend
1. Navigate to the Java backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend/java
   ```
2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```
   mvn clean install
   ```

#### Python Backend
1. Navigate to the Python backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend/python
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   or if using yarn:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

### Cloud Services Setup
(Instructions for setting up cloud services to be added based on specific cloud platform used)

## Running the Application

### Starting the Backend

#### Java Backend
```
cd backend/java
java -jar target/simpletodo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

#### Python Backend
```
cd backend/python
python app/main.py
```

### Starting the Frontend
```
cd frontend
npm start
```
or with yarn:
```
yarn start
```

The application should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`

## Testing

### Running Backend Tests

#### Java Tests
```
cd backend/java
mvn test
```

#### Python Tests
```
cd backend/python
pytest
```

### Running Frontend Tests
```
cd frontend
npm test
```
or with yarn:
```
yarn test
```

## Additional Information

### API Documentation
API documentation is available through Swagger UI. Once the backend is running, you can access it at:
- Java Backend: `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html`
- Python Backend: (Endpoint to be specified)

This README.md file provides a comprehensive overview of the Simple Todo App v2, covering all the major aspects of the project. It includes setup instructions for both the Java and Python backends, as well as the frontend. The structure follows a logical flow, starting with an overview, then moving to setup, running the application, and finally additional information.

A few notes on the content:

1. I've made some assumptions about the specific technologies used (e.g., Spring Boot for Java, React for frontend) based on the file structure and common practices.
2. The cloud services section is left somewhat generic, as we don't have specific information about which cloud platform is being used.
3. I've included placeholders for things like contribution guidelines and license information, which are common in open-source projects.
4. The API documentation section mentions Swagger UI for the Java backend, which is consistent with the use of Swagger annotations in the Java files mentioned in the file summaries.

This README should provide a solid starting point for anyone looking to understand, set up, or contribute to the Simple Todo App v2 project. It can be further customized or expanded based on any additional specific requirements or features of the project.
