# TaskMaster

TaskMaster is a comprehensive task management application with a Python backend and a TypeScript/JavaScript frontend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the Python backend code
- `frontend/`: Contains the TypeScript/JavaScript frontend code

### Backend

The backend is built with Python and is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Source code
  - `controllers/`: Request handlers
  - `models/`: Data models
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
    - `prep.py`: PEP 8 compliance checker
  - `views/`: View functions
- `tests/`: Test files
  - `TestingVinay.py`: Test suite
  - `prepTest.py`: Tests for the prep utility

### Frontend

The frontend is built with TypeScript/JavaScript and is structured as follows:

- `public/`: Public assets
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `src/`: Source code
  - `components/`: React components (assumed based on project structure)
  - `script.js`: Main JavaScript file
  - `styles/`: CSS styles
    - `style.css`: Main stylesheet
  - `typeTest.ts`: TypeScript test file
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
- `tests/`: Test files
  - `Testing.html`: HTML-based tests
  - `typeTest.spec.ts`: TypeScript test specifications

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TaskMaster_6f8d9e2a
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   python src/main.py  # Adjust this command if your entry point is different
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your frontend setup).

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests
```
cd backend
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Frontend Tests
```
cd frontend
npm test
```

Now, let's analyze this generated content:

1. We've provided a high-level overview of the project structure, which aligns with the given directory structure.
2. We've included setup instructions for both the backend and frontend, assuming common practices (like using a virtual environment for Python and npm for the frontend).
3. We've provided instructions on how to run the application and tests, which should be helpful for new contributors or users.
4. We've added placeholders for CONTRIBUTING.md and LICENSE.md files, which are common in open-source projects. These files don't appear in the given directory structure, so we might want to suggest creating them.

However, there are a few assumptions and potential improvements we could make:

1. We assumed the backend entry point is `src/main.py`, but this file isn't in the directory structure. We should add a note about this.
2. We don't have specific information about the frontend framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.). We might want to add a note about this uncertainty.
3. We could provide more details about the project's functionality based on the file summaries we have.

Let's revise our README with these considerations:

# TaskMaster

TaskMaster is a comprehensive task management application with a Python backend and a TypeScript/JavaScript frontend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- `backend/`: Contains the Python backend code
- `frontend/`: Contains the TypeScript/JavaScript frontend code

### Backend

The backend is built with Python and is structured as follows:

- `src/`: Source code
  - `controllers/`: Request handlers
  - `models/`: Data models
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
    - `prep.py`: PEP 8 compliance checker
  - `views/`: View functions
- `tests/`: Test files
  - `TestingVinay.py`: Test suite
  - `prepTest.py`: Tests for the prep utility

### Frontend

The frontend is built with TypeScript/JavaScript and is structured as follows:

- `public/`: Public assets
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `src/`: Source code
  - `components/`: UI components
  - `script.js`: Main JavaScript file
  - `styles/`: CSS styles
    - `style.css`: Main stylesheet
  - `typeTest.ts`: TypeScript test file
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
- `tests/`: Test files
  - `Testing.html`: HTML-based tests
  - `typeTest.spec.ts`: TypeScript test specifications

## Features

- Task management with main tasks and inner tasks
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Local storage for data persistence
- PEP 8 compliance checking for Python code

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TaskMaster_6f8d9e2a
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   # Note: The exact command to start the backend server is not specified in the project structure.
   # You may need to create or identify the main entry point file.
   python src/main.py  # Adjust this command based on your actual entry point
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your frontend setup).

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests
```
cd backend
python -m unittest discover tests
```

### Frontend Tests
```
cd frontend
npm test
```

## Development Notes

- The backend uses Python with a focus on PEP 8 compliance. The `prep.py` utility in `backend/src/utils/` can be used to check code style.
- The frontend uses a mix of TypeScript and JavaScript. The specific framework (React, Angular, Vue, etc.) is not specified in the project structure. Refer to `frontend/src/script.js` and `frontend/src/typeTest.ts` for more details on the implementation.
- The project uses Bootstrap 5.1.3 for styling and jQuery 3.6.0 for DOM manipulation in the frontend.
