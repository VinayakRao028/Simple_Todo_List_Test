## Technologies Used

- Backend: Python
- Frontend: JavaScript/TypeScript, HTML, CSS
- Styling: Bootstrap 5.1.3
- JavaScript Library: jQuery 3.6.0
- Build Tool: Vite (for TypeScript)

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd TaskMaster_6f8d9e2a/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd TaskMaster_6f8d9e2a/frontend
   ```

2. Install the required npm packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

### Backend

1. From the backend directory, start the Python server:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. From the frontend directory, start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified by your frontend setup).

## Testing

### Backend Tests

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd TaskMaster_6f8d9e2a/backend
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```
   python -m unittest discover tests
   ```

### Frontend Tests

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd TaskMaster_6f8d9e2a/frontend
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

As I review this content, I'm considering if it covers all the necessary aspects of the project. Let's analyze each section:

1. Project Overview: It's brief but gives a clear idea of what TaskMaster is.
2. Directory Structure: This is directly from the provided information, which is good for giving new developers an overview of the project structure.
3. Technologies Used: This section combines information from the file summaries and the provided technology stack.
4. Setup Instructions: I've separated this into backend and frontend setup, which seems appropriate for a full-stack application.
5. Running the Application: Again, separated into backend and frontend instructions.
6. Testing: Includes instructions for both backend and frontend tests.
7. Contributing Guidelines: I've added a basic contribution workflow, which is common in open-source projects.

One thing I'm noticing is that we don't have specific information about how to start the backend server or what port it runs on. I've made an assumption that there's a main.py file, but this might need to be adjusted based on the actual project setup.

Also, for the frontend, I've assumed it's using a standard setup with npm scripts, but this might need to be tailored if the project uses a different build process.

I'm wondering if we should add more details about the application's features or usage instructions. However, without more specific information about the application's functionality, it might be best to keep it general.

Let's add a section about the application's features based on what we can infer from the file summaries:

```converted
## Features

- Task Management: Add, delete, and check off tasks
- Nested Tasks: Create inner tasks within main tasks
- Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage
- Responsive Design: Works on various screen sizes
- PEP 8 Compliance Checker: Utility to check Python code for PEP 8 compliance

TaskMaster allows you to:
1. Create new tasks
2. Add inner tasks to main tasks
3. Mark tasks as complete
4. Delete individual tasks or clear all tasks
5. Automatically save your tasks for future sessions
