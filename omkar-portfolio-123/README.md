## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/omkar-portfolio-123.git
   cd omkar-portfolio-123
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install frontend dependencies (if any):
   ```
   # If using npm
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. Start the Flask development server:
   ```
   python run.py
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in the console output).

## API Documentation

The API documentation is available through Swagger UI. After starting the application, visit:

```
http://localhost:5000/api/docs
```

This will provide an interactive interface to explore and test the API endpoints.

## Testing

### Backend Tests

To run the backend tests:

```
python -m pytest tests/backend
```

### Frontend Tests

To run the frontend tests:

```
# If using Jest
npm test
```

## Deployment

(Add specific deployment instructions here, such as how to deploy to a production server or cloud platform.)

This README.md provides a comprehensive overview of the project, including setup instructions, project structure, and guidelines for running and testing the application. It's designed to be informative for both users and developers who might work on the project.

A few notes on the decisions made:

1. I've assumed the use of Flask for the backend based on the project structure and the presence of app/controllers and app/views directories, which are common in Flask applications.

2. The frontend technology is listed as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as these are evident from the public/ directory. If there's a specific framework being used (like React), it should be added to the Technologies Used section.

3. I've included placeholders for deployment instructions and license information, as these details weren't provided in the given context.

4. The contact information is a placeholder and should be updated with the correct email address.

5. The project structure shown in the README is a simplified version of the actual structure provided, focusing on the main directories to give a clear overview without overwhelming the reader.

6. Testing instructions are generic and may need to be adjusted based on the actual testing setup used in the project.

This README should provide a solid foundation for documenting the project. It can be further customized based on any specific requirements or additional features of the portfolio application.
